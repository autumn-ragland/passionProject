## Passion Project - Travel Log
### Concept: 
Interactive map that allows women to access and log information about cities in the US to plan their next trip and/or share a previous trip with other women. Inspired by my own traveling experience and the GirlsLoveTravel facebook group.
### Features:
* Map using the google maps api with markers where women have made log about their travels
* Login and SignUp to record travel logs
* Search to quickly find logs for a specific city or location
* Marker detail page with all logs made at that location and a general rating of the location from all logs (on click)
* Profile page with logged in user's logs
### To Do:
1. Basic set up of Django Project/App
2. Create models (user, travel log, and rating)
3. Embed google map
4. Create logs (full crud)
5. Sign in/Authentication (registration file)
6. Search Bar
7. User Profile Page
8. Fun logo and name
